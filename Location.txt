Program will include a GPS and an implemented map system. App users will use that map (i.e., main campus map)
for meeting easily. "Nearby" section will use the GPS and map to show the nearby events in application.
A user will select the post-it on the mini map and see the details of the event. Right now, we consider having different
maps for different sections (i.e., east/main campus, Bilkent Center, etc.)
